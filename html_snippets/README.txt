Please upload each component as a separate file, with CSS and JS (if necessary) inside. Do not create a separate CSS or JS file. The format should be as follows:

<html>
   <body>
      <p>this is some code</p>
   </body>
</html>

<style>
   p {
      color: black;
   }
</style>

<script>
   function testFunction() {
      console.log("this is a function");
   }
</script>

For any text or image marked with a green or pink box, please use a placeholder and mark the line with <!--placeholder--> this helps me later when I have to change those sections to link to the server.

If you use javascript, please comment it well. Every function should have at least one comment to describe the function's purpose. More comments are helpful. If you notice the "Languages" section on the github page, you will see that most of this website is written in Vue instead of HTML. Vue is very similar to HTML, and they easily convert...except for the javascript. Comments will help me rewrite the functions so they work for the site. If you want to see what Vue looks like, go to front-end/src/views and look at any of the files.

Let me know if I can help with anything, and thanks!
